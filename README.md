# Riya_Soni_SelectionTask

This repository contains my submission for the Land Cover Classification task using ResNet18.

## Project Overview
- Trained a CNN (ResNet18) on satellite land cover data.
- Implemented custom and torchmetrics F1 score evaluation.
- Visualized confusion matrix, training curves, and sample predictions.

## Key Files
- Riya_Soni_SelectionTask.ipynb: Main Jupyter notebook.
- resnet18_landcover_best.pth: Best trained model weights.
- train_losses.npy / val_losses.npy / val_accuracies.npy: Training metrics.
- Provided_Data/: Input datasets.

## Results
- Validation Accuracy: ~90%
- Early Stopping triggered at Epoch 11.
- Grassland and Water bodies showed strong classification performance.
